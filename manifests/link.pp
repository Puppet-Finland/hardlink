#
# == Define: hardlink::link
#
# Create a hardlink from $source to $title (target).
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#   The state of the hardlink. Valid values 'present' (default) and 'absent'.
# [*source*]
#   The source file for the hardlink.
# [*title*]
#   While not strictly a parameter, the resource $title is used as the target of 
#   the hardlink. This allows creating several hardlinks from one $source if the 
#   $title is an array.
